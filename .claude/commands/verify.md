Run the project's verification chain in order. Stop and report the first failure.

1. Typecheck: `svelte-kit sync && svelte-check --tsconfig ./tsconfig.json`
2. Lint: `svelte-check --tsconfig ./tsconfig.json`
3. Test: `vitest run`

After all three pass, state "Verified: typecheck + lint + test green." with the tail of the test output included. If any step fails, show the failing output verbatim and stop — do not attempt a fix unless the user asks.
